# About Us

The club was formed and incorporated March 31, 1972 by a group of families to promote safe enjoyable family style 4 wheeling. We operate as a non-profit dues paying club with elected officers and democratic participation by all members families. No member receives pay for time spent on behalf of the club. Our club by-laws are operating documents are available from the club president, or the secretary on request. Our club meets to carry out the routine club business, plan activities, and develop or discuss new ideas. This meeting is limited to one hour by our by-laws. At least one club sponsored trip is available each month. The time and date of these trips are discussed at our monthly meetings and will be posted on the calendar page. Each trip or outing is planned by a club member who is referred to as the trail leader or his trip or outing. The trail leader is in charge of, but not responsible for each person who attends the trip or outing. This club is dedicated to the premise that our environment and our outdoor heritage must be protected, therefore the willful destruction of private or public property or the needless disfigurement of our land will not be tolerated. Guests as well as members are expected to be conscientious in this respect leaving nothing on a trip but a few tire tracks.

## Official FourWheelers' Code

As members of the American public who operate four wheel drive vehicles to enjoy the awe-inspiring scenery of our mountains, valleys, deserts, forests, marshes, and meadows, and all the other back country areas of the nation, we will: Leave the land and its vegetation as we find it. Help preserve plant life and soil by limiting travel to established roads, trails, and areas where damage will not be done. Avoiding cutting switch-backs and driving through moist meadows which will leave permanent scars. Protect the history of the nation by not disturbing old mining camps, ghost towns, diggings, or other historic or natural values. Respect the rights and property of other user groups such as miners, ranchers, fishermen, hunters, and other recreationists. Conduct all trips in a safe and sane manner. Accept the responsibility of keeping the back country beautiful by packing out litter. Give everyone we meet the courtesy of the road as safely and courtesy are contagious. Observe the local history, the geology of the land and the ecology of the vegetation so that we may fully appreciate the splendor of our national heritage. Prepared for distribution by the Arizona State Association of Four Wheel Drive Clubs.
