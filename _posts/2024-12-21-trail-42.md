Join the Copperstate4Wheelers on Trail 42 on
{{ page.date | date_to_long_string: "ordinal", "US" }}!

Trail 42 was closed for _years_ due to fire damage and was reopened earlier
this year by TRAL. We're excited to be able to do this run again as a club.
This can be challenging run with a lot of articulation, minimal rocks, and a
lot of dirt.

**Meeting Time:** 8:00am

**Meeting Location:** St. Claire Tonto National Forest

**Members Only?** Nope, everyone is welcome!
